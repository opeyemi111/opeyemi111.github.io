<br> Achievement and Success are the part of one's life. I really glorify Almighty God over my life since the first day of my birth to this present moment</br>
<br> At the very beginning of my life, my first life achievement occured during the period of my Primary School when I was chosen as the <b> Health Prefect Boy</b></br>
<br> amidst other students up to 40 (forty) in number in my class. I was so <em>excited</em> for that position which was very a <em>great achievement</em> for me.</br>
<br> When I was admitted into Junior Secondary School that was where I had my second achievement as I was chosen by the School authority as a <strong><b>"Time Keeper".</b></strong>   
<p> Although, the post was so stressful for me to controlled hundreds of students but due to the great achievement it was for me, I endured it. </p>
<br> Moreover, due to some reasons I moved to the new School where I started my Senior Secondary School (SSS). I started partaking in the sport activities</br>
<br> and took part in the <strong>School Inter-House Sport</strong>, I won a cash prize and cup for my House but the biggest of all this sport activities</br>
<br> was when I took part in the <strong>Inter-Local Government Running Sport</strong>, and this also impressed my parents that made them said out that</br>
<p> they would always be in my support.</p>
<br> One of my believe is that before one can achieve in life it must come out of a dream.So being admitted into <b>kwasu</b> world class university made <br>
<br> me always thanking God because of his grace.But with litter difficult,I am maintaining a great opportunity of being a student of this great </br>
<br> institution which is a very great achivement in my life </br>
